# Pig-Game
Pig Game is a two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each player rolls the dice to earn points, but if a 1 is rolled, the turn score resets and switches to the next player. Players can hold their score to secure it, and the first to reach 20 points wins. Fun, interactive, and easy to play!
