# Pig-Game
A fun two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points — but rolling a 1 resets their turn score! Players can choose to “Hold” their score to add it to their total, and the first to reach 20 points wins. The interface updates dynamically with active player highlights, dice visuals, and winner effects.

# Pig Game 🎲
